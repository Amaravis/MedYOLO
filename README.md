# MED_YOLO3D
A 3D bounding box detection model for medical data.

Architecture and pipeline based off YOLOv5 (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) approach, modified for use with 3-D NIfTI scans.  Initially forked from YOLOv5 commit ed887b5976d94dc61fa3f7e8e07170623dc7d6ee.  YOLOv5 code, particularly the utils folder, is reused where possible.
